<p>January 23—Sweden—Approximately 50,000 people in the city of Södertälje lost power for between four and 20 hours after an explosion at the substation supplying the city. A 70 kV circuit breaker exploded at a routine switching operation, the oil mist released from the damaged breaker caused a bigger explosion that demolished the whole upper floor of the substation building which contained the 70 kV switchgear. Emergency repairs were delayed because all transformers in the substation were more or less damaged.</p>

<p>November 9—United States and Canada—The Northeast blackout of 1965 affected portions of seven northeastern U.S. states and Ontario. Most radio and television stations within the area lost power or lost teletype communications, so people within the blackout area relied on broadcasts from other areas to learn information about the blackout.</p>
<h5 id="section-1969">1969</h5>
<p>August 5—United States—A 50-mile (80 km) stretch of Florida's Gold Coast was hit with a general power failure after an explosion at the Cutler Ridge facility. The outage affected more than 2 million people, and created a vast traffic jam. Miami and Fort Lauderdale downtown areas were offline for almost two hours, with other areas dark for much longer periods.</p>

<p>February 7—United States—On that evening, power in parts of the New York City borough of Manhattan was lost for over four hours. The power outage was originally thought to have been caused by an explosion at Con Ed's Waterside power facility on 40th Street and 1st Avenue in Manhattan, but the cause was later suspected to be a result of a fault in a transformer at a substation on 13th Street. New York City television and FM radio stations that transmit from the Empire State Building were off the air. AM radio stations were largely unaffected, as most of their transmitters were located in either Northern New Jersey (e.g. WABC (AM)) or on High Island (e.g. WCBS (AM)) in the Bronx, which was not affected by the blackout. However, several Manhattan AM station studios were affected due to insufficient power backups. Several lines of the IND and IRT subway lines were affected, stranding passengers. At Grand Central Terminal power in the building was lost, but power on the tracks was retained because it ran on direct current. The New York Daily News was also affected when the blackout caused their printing facility to halt operations.</p>

<p>January 14—Sweden—Approximately 25,000 people in the city of Härnösand and nearby countryside suffered a power failure of up to 40 hours after a fire and explosion in the underground substation at Murberget. The root cause of the fire could not be determined but there are at least two plausible theories. One theory says that a 6 kV underground cable was shorted and caught fire outside the station, the fault was never switched off because the DC supply for the protective relays was not working for some reason, the fire spread to other cables and inside the station where soot and smoke caused busbar shorts and arc explosions. The other theory also says that it was initiated by a short in an outgoing 6 kV cable but a malfunctioning protective relay caused a breaker to reclose against the short several times until it exploded. In the aftermath, recruits from the Härnösand Coastal Artillery Regiment were engaged in cleaning up the usable parts of the substation which caused criticism as the recruits had been subjected to carcinogenic debris, strong solvents and possibly residues of PCB or dioxins, without neither knowledge, training nor suifficient protection.</p>

<p>May 10—Romania—A nationwide blackout that lasted 5 hours caused US$1 billion losses, larger than the Vrancea earthquake on March 4. Subsequent investigations showed it was caused by human error.</p>
<p>May 17—United States—Parts of South Florida were blacked out after a malfunctioning relay caused the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station in Miami to go offline.</p>
<p>July 13–14 —United States—In New York City, 9 million people were affected by a power outage. It was a result of a transmission failure due to a lightning strike on power lines. A second lightning strike caused the loss of two more overhead power lines, and the last power connection between New York City and the Northwest. The power outage resulted in high instances of looting occurring over 26 hours.</p>
<p>September 20—Canada—A power outage covered almost the entire province of Quebec, affecting two million people, after a failure at the Montagnais Substation along a series of 735 kV transmission lines connecting to the Churchill Falls Generating Station in Labrador. Power was restored to scattered rural areas within an hour and service was brought back to parts of Montreal and Quebec City within two hours; it took several hours to fully restore power.</p>

<p>July 7—United States and Canada—A powerful wind storm affected a large portion of central North America and caused power outages for about one million customers from Iowa to Ontario.</p>
<h5 id="section-1992">1992</h5>
<p>August 24—United States—As Hurricane Andrew passed over the northern Florida Keys it downed 17 miles (27 km) of power lines, breaking the wooden poles they were strung on, along a path that was in four feet (122 cm) of water, stretching from the Turkey Point Nuclear Plant southward to the upper Keys. The shallow depth prevented the use of large construction barge cranes for rebuilding the power pylons but the water was too deep for land-based construction vehicles. As a result, the Upper and Middle Keys were largely without power for several months as the Middle Keys Electric Co-op only had generating capacity for 10% of its demand. The power lines heading north to Miami were restored much more quickly, as they were strung along the side of US Highway 1 on dry land. Key West power was in the process of decommissioning an end-of-life oil-fired plant and was able to restore 75% generating capacity for the lower keys in one day as there was no storm damage that far south. Key West power was in the process of converting to sourcing 100% of its electricity from the Turkey Point facility.</p>

This drew so much power from the transmission lines on the San Francisco Peninsula that 25 other sub-stations in the city automatically and immediately shut down. Power was not fully restored until almost 4:00 pm PST the same day. Economic costs were estimated in tens of millions of dollars.</p>
<h5 id="section-1999">1999</h5>
<p>March 11–June 22—Brazil—The 1999 Southern Brazil blackout was a widespread power outage (the largest ever at the time) that involved São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Goiás, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul and Rio Grande do Sul, affecting an estimated 75 to 97 million people and lasting 103 days. A chain reaction was started when a lightning strike occurred at 22h 16m at an electricity substation in Bauru, São Paulo State, causing most of the 440 kV circuits at the substation to trip. With few routes for the power to flow from the generating stations via the 440 kV system (a very important system to São Paulo, carrying electricity generated by the Paraná River) a lot of generators automatically shut down because they did not have any load. The world's biggest power plant at the time, Itaipu, tried to support the load that was no longer being supplied by the 440 kV power plants, but the 750 kV AC lines and the 600 kV DC lines that connected the plant to the rest of the system could not take the load and tripped too. In Rio, the military police placed 1,200 men in the streets to avoid looting. In São Paulo, traffic authorities announced they closed the city's tunnels to prevent robberies. More than 60,000 people were on Rio's subway when lights went out. At midnight, power began returning to some areas, with fully power restored on June 22.</p>
<p>July 5—United States and Canada—the Boundary Waters–Canadian derecho cut power to over 600,000 homes in Quebec with additional outages in New England and in the Upper Great Lakes region.</p>

<p>January 27–31—Australia—Hundreds of thousands of homes in Victoria, including Melbourne, suffered various power failures as a result of a record heat wave. It is estimated that over 500,000 residents in Melbourne were without power for the evening of January 30. The outage affected much of central Melbourne with train and tram services cancelled, the evacuation of Crown Casino, traffic light failures, people being rescued from lifts and patrons of the Victorian Arts Centre evacuated and shows cancelled. The outage occurred only an hour after the National Electricity Market Management Company (NEMMCO) issued a statement saying load shedding was ending and power had been restored. Authorities say there had been a major electricity failure in the city's west, caused by the three-day heatwave. It is believed an explosion at South Morang contributed to the power problems along three transmission lines supplying Victoria's west and Victorian power supplier SP AusNet shed 1,000 megawatts.</p>
<p>March 30—United Kingdom—A major power cut hits homes and business in Glasgow and parts of western Scotland. The affected areas included the west end of Glasgow, Bearsden, Clydebank, Helensburgh, Dumbarton and as far afield as Lochgilphead and Oban. Arran was also affected from the outage.

<p>April 15—Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan—A little before 9:00 pm, a severe power cut blacked out up to 80% of Almaty and northern parts of Kyrgyzstan, affecting a few million people for several hours. Power was not restored until after midnight local time.</p>
<p>July 20—United Kingdom—Power was cut to around 100,000 homes in the areas of South East London and North Kent, after vandals deliberately caused a fire near a cable installation, which caused failure of a 132 kV cable and four circuit boards. Due to the nature of the cable, it was impossible to re-route supplies around other cables without overloading them. As a result, power supplies were cut to about half of the homes for approximately four days, while other homes were given three-hour allocations of power followed by six hours "off". Over 70 mobile generators were brought in from around the country to help restore power in what was the largest deployment in London's history.</p>
<p>October 30—New Zealand—At around 8:00 am local time, power was cut to the whole of Northland and most of the northern half of Auckland, affecting 280,000 customers (14.5% of the country). A forklift carrying a shipping container accidentally hit one of the Ōtāhuhu to Henderson 220 kV circuits while the other circuit was out for maintenance, leaving the region supplied by four low capacity 110 kV circuits. Power was restored to the entire region around 11:00 am.</p>
<p>November 10–20—Brazil and Paraguay—Starting at 10:13 pm Brasília official time, the 2009 Brazil and Paraguay blackout was caused by the failure of transmission lines from Itaipu Dam, the world's second-largest hydroelectric dam, affecting over 80 million customers. The failure was caused by a major thunder storm which affected a key transmission line to southeastern Brazil, causing all 20 turbines at the plant to shut down due to the abrupt fall of power demand. Four of Brazil's most densely populated states entirely lost power (including São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro) with 14 more states being partly affected. The entire country of Paraguay experienced the power failure. It took about seven hours for the system to fully recover. This is regarded as one of the largest blackouts in history, taking 10 days for power to be fully restored.</p>
