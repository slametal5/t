                <p>This page documents notable tornadoes and tornado outbreaks worldwide in 2004. Strong and destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the United States, Bangladesh, and Eastern India, but they can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also develop occasionally in southern Canada during the Northern Hemisphere's summer and somewhat regularly at other times of the year across Europe, Asia, and Australia. Tornadic events are often accompanied with other forms of severe weather, including strong thunderstorms, strong winds, and hail.</p>
<p>The United States recorded more tornadoes during this year than any other year on record, with 1,817 touching down across the country.</p>

<p>The same storm system responsible for a small tornado outbreak and notable F2 tornado near Attica, was also responsible for a nighttime high-end F4 tornado that passed near the town of Harper. The rating, however, is a source of controversy. At peak intensity, it completely erased a well-built, two-story farmhouse and scoured away top of basement walls in the process. Complete tree and shrub debarking, as well as deep ground scouring occurred within this tornado. Vehicles and farm equipment were mangled beyond recognition or torn apart and thrown long distances. Five barns adjacent to the farmhouse were also cleanly swept away. The reason for the F4 rating was that the tornado was very slow-moving, which may have added to the extent of the damage, despite the home was anchor-bolted to its foundation. A family survived the tornado underground in their basement, the family dog however was killed.</p>
<h4 id="section-may-2230">May 22–30</h4>
<p>The Hallam, Nebraska, tornado on May 22 was the widest tornado ever recorded at the time at 2.5 miles (4.0 km) in diameter. The F4 tornado caused one death and 37 injuries in the city of Hallam. It was later surpassed by a massive 2.6 mile (4.2 km) wide twister that occurred near El Reno, Oklahoma, on May 31, 2013. That tornado killed 8 people, including 4 storm chasers.</p>
<p>Beginning on May 29, after the Storm Prediction Center issued a high risk for severe weather, 149 tornadoes were confirmed in 32 hours, killing five people. The Memorial Day Weekend outbreak is considered to be one of the most prolific in US history in terms of the number of tornadoes.</p>

<p>Several tornadoes touched down across northern Germany, the Czech Republic, and Hungary on June 9. At 14:30 UTC, an F3 tornado struck Litovel, injuring five people. A T4/F2 tornado injured one person in Lower Saxony, and another F2 tornado struck Budapest.</p>
<h4 id="section-june-1013">June 10–13</h4>
<p>The first day of the three-day tornado outbreak saw several weak tornadoes across Illinois, South Dakota, Colorado, Nebraska and Wyoming. One of these tornadoes are well documented by several chasers and this tornado damaged a farmstead, destroying two trailers while leaving one slightly damaged, injuring two in an overturned vehicle pulling an U-haul trailer, overturning a center pivot irrigation and unroofing couple of outbuildings in Chappell, Nebraska.</p>
<p>A small tornado outbreak began across the Midwestern United States on June 11, mainly in Iowa and Wisconsin. Most of the tornadoes that occurred this day were weak, being rated F0 or F1. However, a few strong tornadoes did touch down, the most significant being an F3 tornado that caused deep ground scouring and destroyed a home near Le Roy, Minnesota. Another F3 tornado touched down from Buena Vista County, Iowa before moving towards Clay County, Iowa where it destroyed an iron bridge while damaging many crops as it raised a large debris cloud. A strong tornado developed in rural area of Mitchell County, Texas after sunset where it rolled a Ford Expedition at a considerable distance and destroyed eight trailers near the end of its life cycle, three motorists would be injured by this tornado. The next day would bring more tornadoes, this time mostly to Kansas. The first tornado was reported near Belle Plaine, which was rated F0. After the first tornado lifted, the same supercell produced another tornado, which would go on to impact structures near Mulvane. This F3 tornado directly hit an anchor-bolted frame house and completely swept it away. Cars from the garage were thrown over 1⁄4 mile (0.40 km) and mangled beyond recognition or crumpled into balls. Two inhabitants survived this tornado under the staircase in the basement. After the Mulvane tornado dissipated, another photogenic tornado touched down near Rock and was rated F0. This supercell would go on to produce several more tornadoes, all of which were rated F0.</p>
<p>The last day of the outbreak brought several weak tornadoes across Michigan, Nebraska, Ohio and Tennessee. A large supercell spawned five weak tornadoes with twin F0 tornadoes that occurred in Lancaster County where both tornadoes would did some damage to trees and outbuildings.  Overall, 46 tornadoes touched down during this outbreak.</p>

<p>On July 13, a large, violent F4 tornado struck Roanoke, Illinois, destroying the Parsons Manufacturing Plant and some civilian residences.

<p>Exceptional tornado activity took place in September, with 297 tornadoes confirmed in the U.S. This set a monthly record for September, and more than doubled the previous record of 139 set in 1967.

<p>In late November, a significant three-day outbreak of tornadoes took place across the Southern United States. The outbreak began on the 22nd, producing six F0 tornadoes in Louisiana and Texas, three of which occurred in the Houston area. The tornadoes caused minimal damage and no injuries.</p>
<p>Tornado activity continued in the same general area on the 23rd. Early on, most of the touchdowns were weak, though an F2 tornado near Kountze, Texas damaged between 10 and 20 houses and killed a woman when trees crushed her mobile home. Several other tornadoes occurred in Texas throughout the afternoon, and soon began touch down in Louisiana as well. An F2 tornado struck the town of Hutton, damaging about 15 houses and injuring three people. Further north, an F3 tornado touched down and ripped directly through the town of Olla, where major damage occurred. A high school in town sustained significant damage, along with 106 homes. Some of the homes only had interior rooms left. A pickup truck outside of town was thrown 200 feet, and in the nearby town of Standard, four homes and a store were destroyed. Overall, the tornado killed one person and injured 20 others. Another F3 touched down near Fayette, Mississippi, destroying a steel-frame shed, damaging several homes, and flattening large swaths of trees.</p>
<p>Vigorous tornado activity continued on the 24th, mainly across Mississippi and Alabama. However, an F2 tornado tore through the northwest side of Slidell, Louisiana, damaging 152 homes in a single subdivision and injuring four people. Numerous tornadoes touched down in Mississippi, with the strongest being an F3 tornado that passed near Noxapater. The tornado downed hundreds of trees, tossed vehicles, and destroyed chicken houses. A house was completely destroyed, resulting in a fatality and two injuries. In Alabama, a large F2 tracked across Autauga, Chilton, and Coosa Counties. The tornado struck the Cooper community, resulting in major structural damage. Another F2 tornado touched down and struck the Talladega Superspeedway, where two concession stands within the infield area of the race track had their roofs blown off. The Bush Garage area received building damage and the garage doors were bowed out. Debris was scattered between the garage area and Victory Lane. One digital leaderboard was completely destroyed and another one sustained major damage. The tornado continued east through Eastaboga, where two homes suffered major roof damage, two porches were destroyed, and many trees were blown down. The tornado then struck Bynum where downed trees heavily damaged two mobile homes, with a 75-year-old woman being killed in one of them. The tornado then caused roof and structural damage in Southern Anniston before dissipating. Overall, the outbreak produced 104 tornadoes and killed four people.</p>
