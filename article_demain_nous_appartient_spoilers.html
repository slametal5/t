He does and realizes that he overreacted (because the situation reminded him of Iiris' betrayal) and apologizes to Sampo when realizing his son really likes Kalle. Panu tells Sampo he loves him no matter what and gives his blessing to the relationship. Later it turns out however that despite mutual attraction, Kalle doesn't want to date Sampo because Sampo hasn't broken up with Cindy and is still too nervous and anxious knowing he's bi (he's always thought he's completely straight and has never had a crush on a male before). Lasse (Timo Jurkka) advises Sampo to try move on and he ends up meeting and sleeping with a guy named Alex. Both Cindy and Kalle see them when they are at Sampo's home making out. This leads Cindy to break up with him, Kalle becoming heartbroken and Alex getting mad at him. Alex later forgives him. Sampo later confesses his love to newly engaged Kalle who doesn't tell him about his engagement but Sampo hears about it from Kalle's fiancé, Petri Simola. After Petri breaks up with Kalle, Sampo and Kalle go on a date and Kalle even cooks dinner for them. Sampo later asks Ismo for Kalle's hand in marriage. When he proposes, Kalle (who has had bad experiences with bad things happening to his fiancés) apologizes and runs away which leads Sampo to break up with Kalle. Thanks to a plot of Ismo and Panu, they get back together and agree to proceed slowly. However, short time later Kalle proposes to Sampo at middle of a mall. Sampo pranks him by running away first (leading Kalle to chase him around the mall) but says "yes". Ismo hears Sampo talking about his con (among other controversial things he has done) with his sister,  Aino (Tiia Weckström) and becomes suspicious about him but allows him to marry Kalle. Ismo accidentally blurts out about Sampo's con to Kalle leading Kalle to kick Sampo out of their home and file for divorce. Later Sampo has a short relationship with a man named Atte Karvinen but learns that Atte is married. After Atte, Sampo swears of men and starts dating Marianna Kurki which makes Kalle (now engaged to Petri and close friend with Sampo) jealous. Kalle even asks Sampo "if he has become straight again". Marianna soon breaks up with Sampo (coincidentally same time, Kalle breaks up with Petri). Sampo ends up comforting heartbroken Kalle and starts hoping they would get back together.</p>

He is at the hospital taking Mira Angervuo back to prison after she gave birth to her and her wife, Viola's baby, Ilo. After Mira hits Petri on the head with a metal rubbish bin and escapes he gets treated by Kalle. Kalle and Petri later agree to go on a lunch date but are (once again) seen by Sampo whom Kalle is still pining for. Kalle later confirmed that he and Petri are dating. Jealous Sampo tries to break them up by claiming that Petri had hit him (in reality Sampo asked his roommate, Joonatan Sievinen to hit him). Petri later proposes to Kalle, who says "yes". After Petri comes to their engagement party drunk, Kalle's father, Ismo (who seems to have preferred Sampo over Petri during whole Petri and Kalle's relationship) tells him that Petri can see Kalle "only over his dead body". Kalle decides to give Petri another chance, but when Petri is hospitalized due drinking related accident, he tells Kalle that he thinks they should break up and re-enters to rehab because he fears that he might cause Kalle to start drinking again. After getting out from rehab Petri runs into Kalle who (now engaged to Sampo) is celebrating his stag party. Petri reveals that he still loves Kalle. Petri and Kalle later get back together and get engaged but Petri gets a guarding job at  the Embassy of Finland in Colombia and moves to  Bogotá.

Alex gets mad at Sampo because he thought Sampo was already publicly out of closet to everyone. He later forgives Sampo for not telling him the truth.

<h4 id="section-eastenders">EastEnders</h4>
<p>EastEnders is a British soap opera broadcast on BBC One, which has aired since 19 February 1985. The show has used various homosexual characters to highlight gay issues since the 1980s, including homophobia, bisexuality, age of sexual consent, and HIV/AIDS among others. It was the first UK soap to screen a gay kiss in 1987, prompting outrage from viewers and the media who branded the programme "filth" and dubbed it "EastBenders". There were even questions in Parliament about whether it was appropriate to have gay men in a family show when AIDS was sweeping the country. Despite initial negativity, the characters had a powerful impact on public attitudes, and the show's handling of Colin and Barry's relationship was deemed by many gay activists as something of a breakthrough. Actor turned politician Michael Cashman believes the storyline started "the social change" in opinion towards homosexuals, which "happened alongside the legal reform" in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The show has been at the centre of much controversy regarding its gay characters kissing on-screen. It screened the first mouth-to-mouth gay soap kiss in the UK in 1989, leading some MPs to call for the programme to be banned. EastEnders' first regular lesbian characters provided the soap with its first lesbian kiss in 1994, provoking more complaints than any other UK television programme that year. This was followed by a "censored" homosexual kiss in 1996, which infuriated gay activists after the BBC cut the kiss from its original two seconds to a half-second, so they would not "startle" viewers. In 2007, a lesbian kiss prompted 211 complaints to the BBC, and in 2008, a kiss between two gay characters prompted 145 complaints from viewers who were "appalled by the display of homosexual kissing before the watershed [...] whilst young children are watching". The BBC released a statement saying: "We approach our portrayal of homosexual relationships in the same way as we do heterosexual relationships. In this instance, Christian is enjoying the first flush of romance and we've shown him being affectionate with his new boyfriend in the same way any couple would."</p>
